1. <span style="color:red">**Computer Model Calibration based on Image Warping Metrics**text</span> [*Paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06608)
    
Sea ice models governed by physical equations have been used to simulate the 
state of the ice including characteristics such as ice fractures or leads in the ice. 
These simulated features can be partially misaligned or misshapen when compared to 
observational data. We develop a statistical emulation and calibration framework that 
accounts for feature misalignment and misshapenness. This involves optimally aligning 
model output with observed features using cutting edge image registration techniques.


2. <span style="color:red">**Fine-Scale Spatiotemporal Air Pollution Analysis using Mobile Monitors on Google Street View Vehicles**text</span> [*Paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03576)

People are increasingly concerned with understanding their personal environment, including possible exposure to harmful air pollutants. In order to make informed decisions on their day-to-day activities, they are interested in real-time information on a localized scale. We analyze fine-scale, high-quality air pollution measurements acquired using mobile monitors and develop a computationally-efficient spatiotemporal model for these data to make high-resolution maps of current air pollution levels and short-term forecasts.


3. <span style="color:red">**A Computationally Efficient Projection-Based Approach for Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed Models**text</span> [*Paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02501)

Non-Gaussian spatial data arise in a number of disciplines such as species counts in ecology. A popular model for such data is the spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs), for which inference is computationally intensive when the data is large. Moreover, spatial confounding makes it difficult to interpret regression coefficients. We propose a novel approach to address both the computational and confounding issues for SGLMMs. We achieve these by replacing the high-dimensional spatial random effects with a reduced-dimensional representation based on random projections.


4. <span style="color:red">**Inferring Ice Thickness from a Glacier Dynamics Model and Multiple Surface Datasets**text</span> [*Paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01454)

The behavior of ice sheets, in particular their melting, can potentially have a significant impact on future climate.  Information regarding properties of ice sheets is obtained from high-quality surface observations and an understanding of glacial physics. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that is flexible and capable of integrating a simple glacier dynamics model, multiple data sets and uncertainty sources to estimate the key parameter in the glacier dynamics model.
