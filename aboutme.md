My name is Yawen Guan, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at University of Nebraska - Lincoln. Prior to joining UNL, I spent two years at SAMSI/NC State University as a postdoctoral fellow developing spatiotemporal methods for air quality, and emulation-calibration methods for the Artic sea ice. 

I received my Ph.D. in statistics from the Pennsylvania State University in 2017 mentored by Dr. Murali Haran. During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to work with top scientists in the study of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. I was intrigued by the ice sheet physics and developed a statistical method to combine physics and multiple data sets to study ice streams on West Antarctica. 

My research interests are
- Spatial and spatiotemporal statistics
- Computer model emulation and calibration
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling
- Cmputational methods for large data
- Climate and environmental applications
