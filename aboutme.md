My name is Yawen Guan, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the SAMSI CLIM Program and NC State University. I work on spatial/spatiotemporal methods for modeling multiple pollutants with Dr. Brian Reich. This fall, I will join the Department of Statistics at University of Nebraska - Lincoln as an Assistant Professor.

I received my Ph.D. in statistics from the Pennsylvania State University mentored by Dr. Murali Haran. During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to work with top scientists in the study of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. I was intrigued by the ice sheet physics and developed a statistical method to combine physics and multiple data sets to study ice streams on West Antarctica. 

My research interests are
- Spatial/spatiotemporal statistics
- Bayesian modeling 
- Cmputational methods for large data
- Climate and environmental applications
